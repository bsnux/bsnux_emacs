Fabric Integration
------------------

Django-mode will interact with fabric for your current project, building a list of functions to auto-complete, and running commands within a \*fabric\* buffer.

Buildout Support
----------------

Django mode is aware of buildout, and will use buildout-root/bin/django to
run management commands when available, manage.py when not.

The command M-x django-buildout will re-run buildout for your current project

M-x django-buildout-bin will run a script from your buildout's bin directory in an interactive buffer

Tags
----

Generate a TAGS table for your project with M-x django-tags
The exact command used is customisable through django-etags-command in
M-x customize-group RET django

Tests
-----

Run tests in in an interactive buffer, allowing you to drop out into ipdb/pdb
as required.

Tests will default to --failfast, but you can turn that off with the variable django-test-failfast or set it in
M-x customize-group django

in a test run buffer, C-c C-g will jump to the last file and line indicated by the traceback.

------------

1. clone this repo somewhere $ git clone http://github.com/davidmiller/django-mode
2. Add the following to your .emacs::

    (load-library "path/to/django")
3. Start programming
